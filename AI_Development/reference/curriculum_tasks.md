# AI Development Curriculum - Task List

This is a task-oriented version of your AI development curriculum, allowing you to track your progress.

## Stage 1: The Beginner - "The Explorer"

**Goal:** Get comfortable with AI, learn the basics, and discover what's possible.

- [x] **Start with Everyday Tasks:** Think of me as a versatile assistant.
    - [x] Summarize a long email for me.
    - [x] Give me 5 healthy and quick dinner ideas.
    - [x] Draft a friendly reminder email to my team about a deadline.

- [x] **Learn the Art of the Prompt:** The quality of my answer depends on the quality of your question. Be clear and specific.
    - [x] Practice being clear and specific in your prompts.
    - [x] Experiment with providing context and personas (e.g., "You are an expert travel agent...").

- [x] **Experiment:** Try different types of requests to see what works best.
    - [x] Ask for summaries.
    - [x] Ask for brainstorming.
    - [x] Ask for explanations.
    - [x] Ask for creative writing.

## Stage 2: The Intermediate - "The Apprentice"

**Goal:** Use AI for more complex, multi-step tasks and integrate it into your regular workflow.

- [x] **Chain Your Commands:** Break down a big task into smaller steps for me to handle in sequence.
    - [x] Brainstorm 10 names for a new tech blog, then write a short, catchy tagline for your favorite 3.

- [x] **Provide Context and Personas:** Tell me who to be. This dramatically improves the output.
    - [x] Create a 7-day itinerary for a trip to Japan, focusing on cultural experiences and good food, with a moderate budget, acting as an expert travel agent.

- [x] **Use AI to Learn:** Treat me as a personal tutor.
    - [x] Explain the concept of 'compound interest' like I'm 15 years old.
    - [x] Write a simple Python script that reads a text file and counts the number of words.

## Stage 3: The Advanced - "The Journeyman"

**Goal:** Automate parts of your workflow and use AI for specialized, professional tasks.

- [x] **Code and Debug:** I can be your coding partner.
    - [x] Get help finding a bug in a Java code snippet (e.g., `NullPointerException`).
    - [x] Write a regular expression to validate an email address.
    - [x] Refactor Python code to be more efficient and add comments explaining changes.

- [ ] **Analyze Data:**
    - [ ] Analyze provided data and identify key trends.
    - [ ] Write a Python script using pandas to clean a dataset (remove duplicates, handle missing values).

- [x] **Create In-Depth Content:**
    - [x] Write a detailed outline for a 3000-word article on the impact of AI on the job market.
    - [x] Generate a set of 5 interview questions for a senior software engineer position.

## Stage 4: The Professional - "The Master"

**Goal:** Push the boundaries, create custom solutions, and operate at the cutting edge.

- [x] **Automate Complex Workflows:** Design "agents" or multi-step prompts that perform entire sequences of tasks with minimal intervention.
    - [x] Create an agent that scours the web for news on a topic, summarizes it, and drafts a report.

- [ ] **Integrate with APIs:** Use the APIs of large language models (like the Gemini API) to build AI into your own applications, scripts, and services.

- [ ] **Fine-Tuning (Conceptual):** For very specific domains, fine-tune models on your own data to create highly specialized experts.
