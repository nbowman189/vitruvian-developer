# Gemini CLI Project

## Directory Overview

This directory is the workspace for the Gemini CLI, an AI agent that brings the power of Gemini directly into the terminal. The purpose of this directory is to store project files, scripts, and documentation related to the development and usage of the Gemini CLI.

## Key Files

*   `GEMINI.md`: This file serves as the instructional context for the Gemini CLI. It contains information about the project, its structure, and how to interact with it. This file should be updated as the project evolves.
*   `docs/curriculum.md`: The primary curriculum for AI development.
*   `reference/personas-reference.md`: Contains reusable, detailed personas for guiding AI tasks.
*   `reference/curriculum_tasks.md`: A task-oriented version of the AI development curriculum for tracking progress.

## Usage

This directory is intended to be used as the primary workspace for interacting with the Gemini CLI. The `GEMINI.md` file will guide the AI agent in understanding the project and performing tasks.

## Schedule

*   **AI Curriculum Start Date:** 11/17/25

# Learning to Use AI Tools Effectively

This guide outlines a structured approach to mastering AI tools, from a beginner to a professional level.

### Stage 1: The Beginner - "The Explorer"

**Goal:** Get comfortable with AI, learn the basics, and discover what's possible.

*   **Start with Everyday Tasks:** Think of me as a versatile assistant.
    *   "Summarize this long email for me."
    *   "Give me 5 healthy and quick dinner ideas."
    *   "Draft a friendly reminder email to my team about the deadline."

*   **Learn the Art of the Prompt:** The quality of my answer depends on the quality of your question. Be clear and specific.
    *   **Instead of:** "Tell me about marketing."
    *   **Try:** "Create a 3-paragraph introduction to digital marketing for a small business owner, covering SEO, social media, and email marketing."

*   **Experiment:** Try different types of requests to see what works best. Ask for summaries, brainstorming, explanations, and creative writing.

### Stage 2: The Intermediate - "The Apprentice"

**Goal:** Use AI for more complex, multi-step tasks and integrate it into your regular workflow.

*   **Chain Your Commands:** Break down a big task into smaller steps for me to handle in sequence.
    *   "First, brainstorm 10 names for a new tech blog. Then, for my favorite 3, write a short, catchy tagline for each."

*   **Provide Context and Personas:** Tell me who to be. This dramatically improves the output.
    *   "You are an expert travel agent. Create a 7-day itinerary for a trip to Japan in the spring, focusing on cultural experiences and good food. The budget is moderate."

*   **Use AI to Learn:** Treat me as a personal tutor.
    *   "Explain the concept of 'compound interest' like I'm 15 years old."
    *   "I'm learning Python. Write a simple script that reads a text file and counts the number of words."

### Stage 3: The Advanced - "The Journeyman"

**Goal:** Automate parts of your workflow and use AI for specialized, professional tasks.

*   **Code and Debug:** I can be your coding partner.
    *   "I'm getting a `NullPointerException` in my Java code. Here's the snippet: `[code]`. Can you help me find the bug?"
    *   "Write a regular expression to validate an email address."
    *   "Refactor this Python code to be more efficient and add comments explaining the changes."

*   **Analyze Data:**
    *   "I have this data: `[paste data]`. Can you analyze it and tell me the key trends?"
    *   "Write a Python script using pandas to clean this dataset by removing duplicate rows and handling missing values."

*   **Create In-Depth Content:**
    *   "Write a detailed outline for a 3000-word article on the impact of AI on the job market."
    *   "Generate a set of 5 interview questions for a senior software engineer position."

### Stage 4: The Professional - "The Master"

**Goal:** Push the boundaries, create custom solutions, and operate at the cutting edge.

*   **Automate Complex Workflows:** You can design "agents" or multi-step prompts that perform entire sequences of tasks with minimal intervention. For example, an agent that scours the web for the latest news on a topic, summarizes it, and drafts a report.

*   **Integrate with APIs:** Use the APIs of large language models (like the Gemini API) to build AI into your own applications, scripts, and services.

*   **Fine-Tuning (Conceptual):** For very specific domains, professionals can fine-tune models on their own data to create highly specialized experts.

The key at every stage is **practice**. The more you use these tools, the more intuitive it will become. Start with Stage 1 and move up as you get more comfortable. I'm here to help you at every step.
