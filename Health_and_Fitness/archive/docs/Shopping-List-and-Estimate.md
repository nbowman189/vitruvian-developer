## Estimated Grocery Cost

**Important Disclaimer:** This is a **rough estimate**. Prices can vary dramatically based on your location (city/state), the store you choose (e.g., Walmart vs. Whole Foods), whether you buy organic, and current sales.

### Estimated Cost Breakdown

**Produce: $45 - $60**
*   This category includes all the fresh vegetables and fruits on your list, like broccoli, avocados, berries, and sweet potatoes. This is often the most variable category based on season and sales.

**Protein: $35 - $45**
*   This assumes you purchase **6 lbs of chicken breast** and **2 dozen eggs**.
    *   Chicken Breast (6 lbs @ ~$4.20/lb): ~$25
    *   Eggs (2 dozen @ ~$3.50/dozen): ~$7
*   If you were to substitute steak for some of the chicken, this cost would increase. Lentils are a very budget-friendly option.

**Pantry: $60 - $85**
*   This includes items you may buy less frequently, and the cost is for the entire package, not just the amount used this week.
    *   **Protein Powder:** This is the biggest variable. A standard 2lb container can range from **$30 to $50**.
    *   **Quinoa/Oats/Seeds/Nuts:** These staples will likely cost **$25 - $35** for standard-sized packages.

### Total Estimated Weekly Cost: **$140 - $190**

**How to Reduce This Cost:**
*   **Protein:** Swapping some chicken meals for lentil-based meals will significantly lower the cost.
*   **Sales:** Look for sales on chicken breast and buy in bulk to freeze.
*   **Produce:** Buy produce that is currently in season in your area.
*   **Pantry:** Choose store brands for items like oats, rice, and seeds. Look for sales on protein powder, as it's a major expense.
