# Complete Weekly Meal Plan

This document provides a complete, flexible meal plan designed to support your fitness goals, including a high activity level of 2 hours of daily walking. The focus is on high-satiety, nutrient-dense meals.

## Part 1: Core Principles & Calorie Structure

*   **Primary Goal:** Sustainable fat loss while fueling a high activity level.
*   **Core Principle:** Build each meal around a large portion of lean protein and high-fiber vegetables. Use complex carbohydrates and healthy fats to fill in the rest of your energy needs.
*   **Flexibility:** This is a template, not a rigid diet. Mix and match the options based on your preference. Listen to your body; if you are feeling exceptionally hungry, add an extra snack or a slightly larger portion of protein.

### Daily Calorie Structure (Adjusted for Activity)

*   **Breakfast:** 600 - 700 kcal
*   **Lunch:** 700 - 800 kcal
*   **Dinner:** 900 - 1,100 kcal
*   **Snacks:** 600 - 800 kcal
*   **Total Daily Target:** **2,800 - 3,400 kcal**

## Part 2: Meal Templates

### Breakfast Options (Choose one each day)

The goal for breakfast is to start your day with a strong dose of protein to control hunger.

*   **1. Protein Shake (Approx. 620 kcal):**
    *   2 scoops (50g) whey or casein protein powder
    *   1.5 cups unsweetened almond milk
    *   1 cup frozen berries
    *   2 tbsp chia seeds or ground flaxseed
    *   1/4 cup dry oats
*   **2. Scrambled Eggs & Veggies (Approx. 650 kcal):**
    *   4 whole eggs, scrambled
    *   1-2 cups of spinach, mushrooms, or bell peppers cooked with the eggs
    *   1 whole avocado
*   **3. Greek Yogurt Bowl (Approx. 700 kcal):**
    *   1.5 cups (330g) plain, full-fat Greek yogurt
    *   1 cup berries
    *   1/2 cup (60g) nuts (almonds, walnuts) or low-sugar granola
*   **4. Upgraded Breakfast Burritos (Approx. 800 kcal):**
    *   2 breakfast burritos (see `recipies.md` for base recipe)
    *   Recommendation: Use lean turkey sausage or add extra eggs to boost protein. Use a whole-wheat tortilla.
    *   Serve with 1/2 an avocado for healthier fats.

### Lunch Template (Component-Based)

Follow the "Daily Assembly" instructions from the prep guide below.

*   **1. Protein Base (Choose one - aim for a 7-8 oz cooked portion):**
    *   Chicken Breast, grilled or baked
    *   Hard-Boiled Eggs (3-4 eggs)
    *   Cooked Lentils (approx 1.5 cups)
*   **2. Vegetable Component (Fill at least 50% of your plate):**
    *   A large serving (2-3 cups) of the roasted and/or fresh vegetables from your weekly prep.
*   **3. Carb Finisher (Aim for a 3/4 cup cooked portion):**
    *   Quinoa or Brown Rice
*   **4. Fat/Dressing:**
    *   Top with a simple vinaigrette (using ~1 tbsp of olive oil) or a squeeze of lemon.

### Convenience Lunch (Fallback Option)

This is a "Good Enough" option for days when you are too busy to assemble the component-based lunch. It hits your calorie and protein targets, but with more processed ingredients.

*   **1. Fortified Skillet Meal (Approx. 800-900 kcal):**
    *   3 servings of a high-protein frozen skillet meal (e.g., Birds Eye Three Cheese Chicken).
    *   Serve on a large bed (2-3 cups) of fresh spinach.

### Dinner Template

Dinner should be your most substantial meal.

*   **1. Protein Base (Choose one - aim for an 8-10 oz cooked portion):**
    *   Chicken Breast
    *   Lean Steak (e.g., Sirloin, Flank)
    *   Lean Ground Turkey or Beef (93/7)
*   **2. Vegetable Component (Choose 1-2 - aim for 2-3 cups):**
    *   Large salad with vinaigrette
    *   Roasted Asparagus or Brussels Sprouts
    *   Steamed Green Beans
*   **3. Carb or Fat Finisher (Choose one):**
    *   1 medium Sweet Potato, baked
    *   1 cup (cooked) Quinoa or Brown Rice
    *   1 whole Avocado

### Snack Ideas (Aim for 600-800 kcal total)

Think of this budget as one or two substantial "mini-meals."

*   A protein shake (1-2 scoops)
*   A full-fat Greek yogurt cup with a handful of nuts
*   2-3 hard-boiled eggs
*   A large apple with 2-3 tablespoons of peanut butter
*   A quality protein bar
*   A large bowl of cottage cheese with fruit
