## Part 1: The Nutrition Plan

This is the most critical area for your fat loss goal. Your previous intake of 3,000-3,400 calories is too high. We are establishing a new, disciplined baseline. Simplicity is key, so we'll use templates and your existing prep habits.

### Daily Targets:
*   **Calories:** **2,500 kcal**
*   **Protein:** **220g**

Don't worry as much about carbs and fats right now. **Your mission is to hit your calorie and protein targets every single day.**

### Sample Meal Structure:

**Breakfast: The Leaner Burrito (Prep-friendly)**
*   Your current breakfast burritos are great, but we're making them leaner to cut calories.
*   **Modification:** When you batch prep, use lean ground turkey or chicken instead of sausage. Use 2 whole eggs + 4 egg whites per burrito instead of all whole eggs. Use low-carb/high-fiber tortillas.
*   *Estimated Macros (2 burritos): ~600 kcal, ~60g protein*

**Lunch: Protein & Greens Template (Simple & Fast)**
*   **Formula:** 1-2 portions of lean protein + 1-2 cups of green vegetables.
*   **Example 1 (Standard):** 8 oz grilled chicken breast strips (buy pre-cooked) + a bag of microwavable steamed broccoli.
*   **Example 2 (Optimal Prep-Friendly):** Combine a half-portion of your pre-cooked rice & beans with 6 oz of grilled chicken breast strips. This can be served over a bed of baby spinach.
*   *Estimated Macros for Example 2: ~563 kcal, ~58g protein*

**Dinner: The Recomp Salad**
*   **Modification:** Keep your big salad, but swap the 8oz breaded chicken for 8oz of grilled chicken. For dressing, switch to a Greek yogurt-based ranch or a light vinaigrette.
*   *Estimated Macros: ~650 kcal, ~60g protein*

**Snacks / Protein Shake:**
*   **Hard-Boiled Eggs:** Prep these. Two eggs are ~150 kcal and 12g protein.
*   **The Sustainable Protein Shake:** You need a go-to recipe. This is non-negotiable for hitting 220g of protein.
    *   2 scoops Orgain Plant-Based Protein Powder (or similar)
    *   12 oz Unsweetened Almond Milk
    *   1 large handful of spinach (you will not taste it)
    *   1/2 banana or 1 cup of berries
    *   *Estimated Macros: ~450 kcal, ~40-50g protein*

## Part 2: The Workout Plan (4-Day Upper/Lower Split)

*   **Schedule:** 4 days/week for 60 minutes. Example: Mon(Upper), Tue(Lower), Thu(Upper), Fri(Lower).
*   **Core Principle:** Progressive Overload. Your job is to get stronger. Log every workout. Once you can hit the top of the rep range for all sets, increase the weight or use a more difficult progression/band.

### Day 1 & 3: Upper Body (Pull-up Focus)

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A: Pull-up Progression** | 4 x 6-8 | **This is the priority.** Start with **Band-Assisted Pull-ups**. Choose a band that makes 6 reps challenging. Your goal is to use thinner bands over time. |
| **B: Ring Push-ups** | 4 x 8-12 | Focus on deep reps. Elevate your feet to make it harder as you get stronger. |
| **C1: Dumbbell Rows** | 3 x 10-15 | Use your 20lb dumbbells. Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades. |
| **C2: Dumbbell Overhead Press** | 3 x 10-15 | Seated or standing. Controlled movements. |
| **D: Active/Passive Hang** | 3 x 30-45 sec | After your last set, just hang from the bar for as long as possible to build grip strength. |

*(Note on C1/C2: These are a "superset." Do a set of C1, rest 60s, do a set of C2, rest 60s, repeat.)*

### Day 2 & 4: Lower Body & Core

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A: Goblet Squats** | 4 x 10-15 | Use your heaviest dumbbell. Focus on going deep while keeping your chest up. |
| **B: Dumbbell Romanian Deadlifts**| 4 x 12-15 | Use your 20lb dumbbells. Hinge at the hips, feel the stretch in your hamstrings. |
| **C: Walking Lunges** | 3 x 20 (total) | Can be done with or without dumbbells. |
| **D1: Ab Wheel Rollouts** | 3 x 8-15 | Go as far as you can with good form. If you don't have a wheel, do Planks for 60s. |
| **D2: Kettlebell Swings** | 3 x 15-20 | Start with the 20 or 25lb KB. This is a conditioning finisher. Focus on explosive hip hinge form. |

## Part 3: Goals & Tracking Protocol

This is how we measure success and stay on track.

### The Pull-up Ladder:
Your path to one pull-up is a step-by-step process.
*   **Level 1 (Current):** Band-Assisted Pull-ups (4x6-8 reps). Master this.
*   **Level 2:** Negative Pull-ups. Jump to the top of the bar and lower yourself down as slowly as possible (aim for 5-10 seconds). Do 4 sets of 3-5 reps.
*   **Level 3:** First Unassisted Rep.

### Tracking:
*   **Weight:** Weigh yourself 3-4 times per week (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri morning) and take the weekly average. Don't obsess over daily changes.
*   **Measurements:** Every 2 weeks, on a Sunday morning, take a photo from the front, side, and back. Measure your waist at the navel.
*   **The Sweater Test:** Try on the 2XL sweater every 4 weeks. Note the change in fit.
*   **Logs:** Log every workout and every meal. This data is how we make adjustments. If you stall for 2 weeks, we will use the logs to identify the problem and fix it.

This is your plan. It is a direct reflection of your goals and the principles of effective recomposition. The plan is engineered for success. Now, you just have to execute.
