# 3-Week Foundational Workout Plan (Phase 1A)

This plan is your guide for the next three weeks, focusing on building the foundational strength required to progress to the next sub-phase of your ring training.

**Goal:** Master the exercises in "Sub-Phase 1A: Foundation Building" by improving rep counts, form, and time under tension.

**Schedule:** 3 workouts per week on non-consecutive days (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday).

**Core Principle:** Strive for progressive overload. Each workout, try to add one more rep to a set, hold for a few seconds longer, or improve your form (e.g., use less leg assistance, lower your body angle in rows).

### **Week 1: Building the Base**

The focus this week is on consistency and learning the movements. Don't push to failure yet; focus on quality reps.

*   **Monday: Push Workout**
    *   **Ring Push-ups:** 4 sets of 8 reps (with as much leg assistance as needed to complete the reps with good form).
    *   **Ring Support Hold:** 3 sets, hold for 30 seconds.

*   **Wednesday: Pull Workout**
    *   **Ring Bodyweight Rows:** 4 sets of 10 reps.
    *   **False Grip Hang:** 3 sets, hold for 30 seconds.

*   **Friday: Push Workout**
    *   **Ring Push-ups:** 4 sets of 8-10 reps (try to beat Monday's performance).
    *   **Ring Support Hold:** 3 sets, hold for 30-35 seconds.

### **Week 2: Increasing the Demand**

This week, we increase the volume and intensity slightly. Focus on making the exercises harder.

*   **Monday: Pull Workout**
    *   **Ring Bodyweight Rows:** 4 sets of 10-12 reps (if you can, lower your body angle to make it more challenging).
    *   **False Grip Hang:** 3 sets, hold for 35 seconds.

*   **Wednesday: Push Workout**
    *   **Ring Push-ups:** 4 sets of 10-12 reps.
    *   **Ring Support Hold:** 3 sets, hold for 35-40 seconds.

*   **Friday: Pull Workout**
    *   **Ring Bodyweight Rows:** 4 sets of 12-15 reps (challenge yourself with the angle).
    *   **False Grip Hang:** 3 sets, hold for 40 seconds.

### **Week 3: Pushing Towards Progression**

This is the final week of the foundational phase. Push yourself to hit the top end of the rep and time ranges, which is the signal that you are ready to move on.

*   **Monday: Push Workout**
    *   **Ring Push-ups:** 4 sets of 12-15 reps (at a more challenging angle).
    *   **Ring Support Hold:** 3 sets, hold for 40-45 seconds.

*   **Wednesday: Pull Workout**
    *   **Ring Bodyweight Rows:** 4 sets of 15 reps (at your most difficult angle so far).
    *   **False Grip Hang:** 3 sets, hold for 45 seconds.

*   **Friday: Push Workout**
    *   **Ring Push-ups:** 4 sets to failure at a challenging angle.
    *   **Ring Support Hold:** 3 sets to failure (hold for as long as possible).

### **After Week 3: Evaluation**

At the end of this 3-week block, evaluate your performance against the "Progression Criteria" for Sub-Phase 1A in the `fitness-roadmap.md`:

*   **Push Progression:** Are you consistently performing push-ups with your body at a 45-degree angle or lower, and can you hold the support holds for 45 seconds?
*   **Pull Progression:** Can you perform rows with your body at a 45-degree angle or lower?

If the answer is yes, you are ready to start incorporating exercises from **Sub-Phase 1B** into your routine. If not, repeat Week 3 until you meet the criteria.
