                    <p>Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man represents the ideal of universal human potential—a figure perfectly proportioned, capable of excellence across disciplines. This concept inspires my approach to development, fitness, and personal growth.</p>

                    <p>Just as da Vinci mastered art, engineering, anatomy, and philosophy, I believe in cultivating excellence across multiple domains: <strong>disciplined code</strong>, <strong>cutting-edge AI</strong>, and <strong>physical mastery</strong>. These aren't separate pursuits—they reinforce each other.</p>

                    <p>The lessons learned in the gym (consistency, progressive improvement, resilience) apply directly to software engineering. The structured thinking required for architecture translates to optimizing fitness routines. The curiosity driving AI research fuels continuous personal growth.</p>

                    <p>This is the Vitruvian Developer: someone who refuses to be compartmentalized, who sees engineering not as separate from life, but as a reflection of how to live well—with discipline, intention, and constant growth.</p>

                        <h3 class="act-title">Act 1: The Foundation</h3>
                        <p class="story-intro">I was sitting in a soils lab in Iraq, crunching soil composition numbers on Army forms. My job as a Technical Engineer Specialist was precision work—surveying, drafting, soils analysis. When the numbers were wrong, people could get hurt.</p>

                        <p>So naturally, I looked at the manual process we were using and thought: <em>This is a system. And every system has failure points.</em></p>

                        <p>The Army had specific forms we'd fill out by hand. Numbers written, math calculated, all points of potential error. I had a background in Excel, so I did what any engineer would do: I built a better system. I recreated the forms digitally, automating the calculations, removing the human error from the equation.</p>

                        <p>After the military, my path wasn't a straight line to a server room. Instead, I pursued a Bachelor of Arts in History with minors in Classical Civilizations and Religious Studies. Studying history taught me how complex, self-managing systems are organized. The Romans had a sophisticated architecture of governance, but when the system developed cascading failures, the empire fell—not because of a single event, but because the architecture became unstable at its core.</p>

                        <p>This wasn't just history. It was a masterclass in scalable systems, external pressures, and the critical importance of a stable core architecture. I was learning <strong>the ability to see entire systems, not just immediate problems.</strong></p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="story-divider"></div>

                    <div class="story-section">
                        <h3 class="act-title">Act 2: The Detour</h3>
                        <p>With a History degree, I took an unexpected path into teaching Exceptional Student Education. There were moments of incredible reward—seeing a student succeed because someone believed in them.</p>

                        <p>But I began recognizing something critical: I was solving the wrong problem. I was competent as a teacher, but I was building someone else's success on foundations I hadn't yet laid for myself. The teaching environment had too many uncontrollable variables—and I needed to return to work where I could <em>design systems</em> instead of <em>manage chaos.</em></p>

                        <p>As my focus shifted, another realization emerged: <strong>I was engineering success for others, but I had failed to engineer my own health.</strong></p>

                        <p>My father had a negative health event. When I looked at the trajectory of his life—his choices in food, his approach to fitness—I saw how poor systems lead to cascading failures. It was a pattern recognition moment. The same principle I saw in Rome, in empires, in database architecture—it applied to human health too.</p>

                        <p>I returned to technology. I progressed through three levels—helpdesk to Solutions Engineer to Sr. Data Solutions Engineer—in four years. But this time was different. I now had two parallel projects: my career, and my health.</p>
