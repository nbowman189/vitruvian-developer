## Key Concepts to Understand

### YAML Front Matter
Metadata at top of `_project_summary.md` file enclosed in `---`:
```yaml
---
title: "Project Name"
disciplines: [code, ai]
...
---
```
This data is automatically extracted and displayed.

### Markdown Content
Content below the YAML front matter is rendered as markdown:
```markdown
---
...metadata...
---

# This becomes the main content
```

### Automatic Processing
When you create `_project_summary.md`:
1. Flask API parses the YAML
2. JavaScript fetches the data
3. Template auto-populates sections
4. Page renders beautifully

### No Manual Styling Needed
Everything is styled automatically based on:
- Your discipline choices
- The design system colors
- Responsive CSS
- Embedded styling

---

## Disciplinary Color Codes

Use these in `disciplines` array:

| Code | Name | Color | Use For |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| `code` | Code & Engineering | Navy (#1a237e) | Software projects |
| `ai` | AI & Learning | Purple (#6a5acd) | ML/AI projects |
| `fitness` | Fitness & Discipline | Amber (#ffb347) | Health projects |
| `meta` | Philosophy & Meta | Cyan (#06b6d4) | Reflection/growth |

Use multiple disciplines if project spans areas:
```yaml
disciplines: [code, ai, fitness]
```
