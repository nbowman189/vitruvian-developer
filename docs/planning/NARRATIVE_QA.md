  Please answer these as thoughtfully as you can. Your stories and feelings are the key.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                      
  Part 1: The Foundation                                                                                                                                              
   1. During your time in the Army as a Technical Engineer, what was a specific problem you had to solve that you're still proud of? What did it teach you about      
      structure and precision?    
    A: My job as a “Technical Engineer Specialist” encompassed 3 areas: Surveying, Drafting, and Soils Analysis. While serving in Iraq, we had to do a lot of number crunching for the soils analysis and the Army had specific forms that we would fill out to determine the results. However, as I am systems conscious, I knew that filling out a form had room for error since we could write a number incorrectly, do the math incorrectly, etc. Since I had a decent background in MS Excel, I decided to recreate the forms in Excel to help remove some of the potential human error and streamline report preparation.    
                                                                                                                                 
   2. You studied History and Classics, not Computer Science. How does thinking like a historian—analyzing sources, understanding context, seeing long-term           
      trends—make you a better engineer today?   
    A: In addition to History and Classics, I also studied religion. The addition of that third area really brought everything together for me in terms of how a complex system is organized and can be made to be generally self-managing. Looking at a society through the dominant religion helped me to better understand the way that rules had to be developed to maintain, in database terms, referential integrity. The historic view also helped me to be able to assess a complex system in how it evolved and, generally, eventually fell to the flaws inherent in its structure. For example, In the Roman Empire, the single greatest point of failure was the Emperor himself. As the emperor became less stable, so went the Empire. This, of course was in addition to the other factors of Germanic pressures due to the Mongolian invasions and such. But, all of this again demonstrates the concept of building scalable systems that are able to be modified when additional new input or context is provided.
                                                                                                                     
   3. You were repeatedly the "IT Support" person in various roles. What did you enjoy about being the person who fixed things for others?
    A: Mostly, I just enjoyed being able to help others who were weaker in the tech domain with something that I had a strength in. In return, they regularly helped me in the areas that I struggled in.  
                                                                                                                                                                      
  Part 2: The Detour & The Imbalance                                                                                                                                  
   4. What motivated you to become a teacher for students with exceptional needs? What was the most rewarding part of that job?
    A: Getting a job when all you have is a History degree and no work experience is very challenging. After moving around and trying to find my footing, I ended up moving with family in FL. My Aunt was a teacher and found out that I could get a job teaching with my degree with a temporary teaching license while I did course work to get the full licensure. I ended up teaching Exceptional Student Education because that was the position that they needed to fill and I though that with my background in literature and history, I had enough tools in my toolbox to help bridge the gap between where the students were academically (performing multiple grade levels below their current grade due to a variety of learning disabilities) and where they needed to get to in order to function productively once they left school. The most rewarding part of the job for me was when students started to succeed because they finally had someone who believed in them and made the path to success doable with just a bit of discipline and repetition.
                                       
   5. Describe the feeling during that period. Was there a disconnect between the fulfillment you got from teaching and how you felt about your own health and        
      personal systems? Be specific.
    A: During the period I felt out of place. I didn’t go to school to be a teacher. I wasn’t trained. I was always one of the most successful students when I was in school and I wasn’t sure how to fully relate to these students that were struggling with very real disabilities. I felt so under prepared and insufficient when it came to meeting my students needs. After my first year of teaching, someone in my family had some health issues and it made me think about my own trajectory. I started doing research and came across the concept of a low-fat, whole foods, plant-based diet. After digging into what it meant and how to do it, I decided to see what happened if I did it for 2 weeks. Then, when I finished the first two weeks, I found that it wasn’t so bad. So, I kept going. As I started taking charge of my physical health and removing the foods that were getting in the way of my accomplishing my physical health goals, I realized that I needed to do the same for my emotional health as it related to my job.
 
  Part 3: The Catalyst & The Return                                                                                                                                   
   6. What was the specific moment or event that made you say, "I need to get back into technology full-time"? What was the driving force behind that decision?
    A: The specific moment that I realized that I needed to leave teaching and return to technology was following a significantly negative encounter with a student and their parent. I realized that working with students and their parents was not an environment that suited me well as there were too many variables for me to be able to manage and control. I finished out that school year so that I didn’t abandon my other students even though I wanted to quit 3 months early. Then, I decided to move back to where I had gone to school and pick up work at my former college in the hopes that I could use that summer job to angle into an IT position that I knew I could succeed in.
 
   7. Similarly, what was the catalyst for your health transformation? Was it a specific event, a number on the scale, or a slow realization
    A: Partly already answered, but my father had a negative health event. When I was told of this event, I looked at the course of his life and his choices in food and physical fitness and couldn’t help seeing how those choices all culminated to result in his negative health event. I can’t say that it wouldn’t have happened anyway. But, it wouldn’t have had the additional complications that he experienced.
 
  Part 4: The Synergy                                                                                                                                                 
   8. What was the very first "tech" principle you consciously applied to your fitness journey? (e.g., "If I can manage a database of 21,000 contacts, I can manage a 
      log of my own calories.") 
    A: The first “tech” principle that I consciously applied to my fitness journey was that you always have to start by planning that algorithm – the road map – for what your going to build so that you know once you’ve completed what you set out to do.

   9. Describe the feeling when you first saw a positive trend in your health data that was a direct result of your own "engineering." How did that compare to the    
      satisfaction of solving a complex technical problem at work
    A: I was excited to see the improvement. But I struggled with just how long I knew that accomplishing the full goal was going to take. Unlike programming where you can do short, intense sprints, Fitness is a marathon. Not having built any large projects that took anything more than 2 weeks to complete, I really struggled with trusting and maintaining adherence to the plan.
 
  Part 5: The Expansion                                                                                                                                               
   10. What specific problem were you trying to solve with Python automation that made you realize you needed to learn more about AI and machine learning?
    A: Most of my Python programming has just been to import and export data to the database or to pull data from the database for calling APIs for account management in platforms such as Microsoft 365. But, all of my database and python programming was self taught. I started as a computer science major in college and took 3 intro courses (Intro to Programming using C++, Data Structures using C, and Computer Assembly and Architecture). So, even though I had a solid foundation for understanding the logic, I never felt like I had solid foundations for best practices on larger projects, how to build APIs, routes, etc. I watched a lot of YouTube videos that explored how others were harnessing AI and realized that I could do the same to help fill in some of the foundational gaps in my knowledge base. I had also let my fitness slip in the previous 5 years since I had first taken control of my health. So, I figured that I could treat my health and fitness like a project just like I was going to treat my AI development.
 
   11. How do you see AI as a tool for personal development, beyond just its technical applications?
    A: So far, One of the best tools has been the use of personas. I was able to create a Transformative Trainer personal that I can use to help me stay on track with exercise and dietary plans because I don’t fear letting the AI down in the same way that I fear letting down a personal trainer. Of course, the reality is that I’m only letting myself down. But, AI being the accountability partner further reinforces that reality. What I do is mine to own – whether what I do leads to progress or regression, that is on me.
                                                                                                                                                                      
  Part 6: The Unified Philosophy                                                                                                                                      
   12. If you had to explain the "Vitruvian Developer" philosophy to someone in a single sentence, what would it be? 
    A: “Vitruvian Developer” is a concept that means, to me, balancing all areas of effort (professional development, work projects, physical health, emotional health, and relational health) in the same way that Da Vinci used mathematical calculations to describe the perfectly proportioned man.

   13. What is the ultimate goal of this journey? What does the fully "optimized" version of yourself look like in 5 years?                                           
    A: The ultimate goal of this journey will have me being physically fit and healthy (something I haven’t been able to achieve since finishing Basic Training in the Army), fully present emotionally and in my relationships, a productive member of my team at work, and someone that knows the value he brings to the table and is a someone that companies are recruiting. Right now, based on my knowledge and skillset, I’m not sure that I could get another job in this field that pays comparably to my current position.
